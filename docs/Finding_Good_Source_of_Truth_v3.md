# PART 1: CORE PHILOSOPHY
*Update rarely â€” this is the foundation*

---

## The Problem

Most people don't fail because they lack talent, motivation, or care.

They struggle because they've been given a false choice:

**One side says:** "Relationships don't matter. Just get the work done. I don't care how you did it, as long as it's done."

**The other side says:** "We need to connect. We need to be like family. We need to love each other."

Both are wrong. And both fail for the same reason.

The actual dependency isn't closeness. It isn't separation. It's **integrity** â€” the ability to trust each other based on shared clarity and proven reliability.

You can be close friends and still fail â€” if you can't predict what each other will do.
You can be purely transactional and still fail â€” if you're not aligned on what actually matters.

For millions of years, the challenges we faced together built the trust we needed. The work WAS how we developed integrity with each other. We've separated them â€” treating connection as a nice-to-have instead of the operational requirement it actually is.

**This is not a motivation problem. It's an integrity problem.**

The world isn't coming at you. It only feels that way because we've stopped asking the questions that build the trust we're designed to depend on.

### The Hidden Danger

The most dangerous integrity drift isn't when we hide the truth. It's when we think we're being clear and we're not.

You can feel completely honest and still have an integrity problem â€” because the other person heard something different than what you meant. You're both operating in good faith, talking about different things. Neither of you knows it until something breaks.

**Unclear communication IS an integrity issue** â€” even when intentions are good.

And here's what makes it corrosive: when communication is unclear, both people think the OTHER one lacks integrity.

"I told you what I needed."
"I was clear about the deadline."
"We agreed on this."

When it breaks down, each person feels honest â€” so they conclude the other must have failed. Must not have listened. Must not have followed through. Must not be trustworthy.

This is how teams fracture. How relationships erode. How organizations split into factions that don't trust each other â€” while everyone feels justified.

**Clarity isn't about being a better communicator. It's about not accidentally destroying trust while feeling completely honest.**

---

## Narrative Integrity Defined

**Narrative Integrity** is the ability to:

1. **Prioritize clearly** â€” name what actually matters, not what's urgent or easy
2. **Prove reliably** â€” own the actions that created your outcomes, so you can repeat them
3. **Predict together** â€” align with others so you can see what's coming and act on it

When these three are present, you can trust yourself. When they're shared, others can trust you. That's integrity â€” not a feeling, but a functional reliability that makes collaboration possible.

> Narrative integrity is not closeness. It's not separation. It's the operational ability to be trusted â€” because you're clear on what matters, you know how you got here, and you can predict where you're going. When a team has this, they don't need to be family. They don't need to keep work and relationship separate. They can depend on each other because they've built something real.

---

## Why This Matters

When we drift from integrity and don't address it, we're complicit in the consequences â€” not just for ourselves, but for everyone who depends on us.

The people around you â€” your family, your team, your community â€” experience the version of you that shows up. When you lack clarity, they get confusion. When you can't prove your process, they can't learn from you. When you can't predict, they can't trust your direction.

**Seeking integrity isn't selfish. It's necessary.**

When we minimize our capacity, we teach others to do the same. When we refuse to act on what matters, we normalize disengagement as survival.

---

## The Core Skill

**Narrative curiosity** â€” the ability to draw out what's true (in yourself and others) through questions rather than SOFA (Suggestions, Opinions, Feedback, Advice).

This is applied through the **Prioritize â†’ Prove â†’ Predict** framework:

- **Prioritize:** Name what actually matters â€” and share it
- **Prove:** Own the actions that created your outcomes â€” and question others to surface theirs
- **Predict:** Align the story of how you created the present with what you're trying to create next â€” together

The questions that drive these aren't new. They're the ones we've forgotten we were designed to ask.

---

## The Evolutionary Anchor: Finding Blueberries

Connection was built around campfires.

After the hunt, we didn't just report what happened. We asked each other questions â€” what worked, what didn't, how did you do that, what should we do tomorrow. Those questions did three things:

1. **They revealed priorities.** What we asked about showed what actually mattered â€” not what we said mattered.
2. **They surfaced proof.** Questioning the process made it repeatable, teachable, transferable.
3. **They built prediction.** Over time, shared questioning created understanding so clear we could anticipate what each other would do.

The questions weren't separate from the work. They were how the work became trustworthy.

Finding a single blueberry was cause for storytelling and group cohesion â€” because someone asked about it, which meant it mattered.

**Priority isn't what you say is important. It's what you ask about. What you make easy to share. What you question at the end of the day.**

If we're not asking, it's not a priority. If we're not making it easy to ask, we've already deprioritized it.

**Finding Good is digital campfire practice â€” reclaiming the questions we were designed to ask.**

---

## What Integrity Actually Means

Integrity is not a personality trait. It's a functional state.

You have integrity when:
- You're clear on what matters (priorities)
- You can articulate how you got here (proof)
- Others can predict what you'll do (reliability)

This isn't about being a "good person." It's about being someone who can be trusted â€” by yourself and by others.

Integrity isn't just about honesty. It's about *receivable* honesty.

If you can't communicate what you think clearly enough for others to act on it, you don't actually have integrity with them â€” you have good intentions with poor delivery. The gap between what you meant and what they heard is where trust breaks down.

**Owning your space means telling the truth about where you actually are â€” so you can move from there, and so others can move with you.**

---

## Proof Is Evidence, Not Reassurance

Proof is not something we give to make someone feel better.

**Proof is evidence.**

It includes:
- What you did
- What worked
- How it worked
- What you felt when it was working (the signal that you're on the right track)

"I don't care how you did it, as long as it's done" destroys proof. It treats outcomes as the only thing that matters and process as disposable. But if you can't articulate how you got there, you can't repeat it. And if you can't repeat it, you don't own it â€” you got lucky.

**Proof is epistemic, not emotional.** Though emotional data is part of the evidence â€” the feeling that showed up when things were working is a signal worth recognizing.

---

# PART 2: THE FIRES FRAMEWORK
*Update rarely â€” this is the model*

---

## What FIRES Represents

FIRES describes five internal navigation systems your brain uses when deciding how to act. Each one can be measured for clarity and confidence.

| Element | Label | Core Question | Science Anchor |
|---------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **F** | Feelings | What signals I'm on the right track? | **Affect Labeling:** Naming emotions moves brain activity from amygdala to prefrontal cortex |
| **I** | Influence | What can I actually control? | **Locus of Control:** Agency is the foundation of resilience |
| **R** | Resilience | How have I handled difficulty before? | **Cognitive Reappraisal:** Reframing failure as data allows sustained effort |
| **E** | Ethics (Why) | What actually matters here? | **Eudaimonic Well-being:** Purpose-driven motivation outlasts reward-driven |
| **S** | Strengths | What do I bring to this? | **Self-Efficacy:** Belief in capacity to execute specific actions |

**Note:** The "E" in FIRES stands for Ethics. In user-facing materials, this element is described as "your deeper Why" or "Purpose and Values."

### How FIRES Maps to the Three Ps

All five elements need both **clarity** (can you articulate it simply?) and **confidence** (do you have evidence?).

| FIRES Element | Clarity Check | Confidence Check |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| Feelings | Can they name the signal simply? | Evidence of when it showed up? |
| Ethics | Can they state what matters without a tangled list? | Times they acted on it? |
| Influence | Can they name what they control specifically? | Where they've exercised it? |
| Resilience | Can they describe how they handle difficulty? | Times they've done it? |
| Strengths | Can they name what they bring? | Proof with examples? |

**What the AI measures:**

| Signal | What It Looks Like |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Clarity** | Specific, simple, single-focus. Low hedging. Concrete language. |
| **Confidence** | Evidence provided. Process described. Specifics, not assertions. |
| **Alignment** | Stated priorities match described actions. Claims supported by proof. |

**The Predictability Score** aggregates clarity + confidence + alignment across all FIRES elements to show overall readiness.

---

## The Four Zones

Each FIRES element can be mapped to a zone based on two dimensions:
- **Clarity/Confidence:** How clearly can you articulate this?
- **Alignment:** Does your experience support what you're claiming?

```
                    HIGH CLARITY/CONFIDENCE
                          â”‚
           PERFORMING     â”‚     OWNING
           (Reconnect)    â”‚     (Extend)
                          â”‚
    â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
                          â”‚
           EXPLORING      â”‚     DISCOVERING
           (Refine)       â”‚     (Bring Forward)
                          â”‚
                    LOW CLARITY/CONFIDENCE
    
    LOW ALIGNMENT â—„â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â–º HIGH ALIGNMENT
```

| Zone | Clarity/Confidence | Alignment | The Work |
|------|-------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Exploring** | Low | Low | Stay curious, refine the question |
| **Discovering** | Low | High | Bring forward past success â€” proof exists but isn't connecting |
| **Performing** | High | Low | Reconnect to evidence â€” confident but not grounded |
| **Owning** | High | High | Extend to others â€” share what you've learned |

**Critical reframe:** The zones are not scores to optimize. They are signals showing where to adjust. Movement is toward clarity, not necessarily toward Owning.

### How Zones Relate to Predictability

The **Predictability Score** is the overall measure: How predictable is your outcome based on clarity of priorities and confidence in proof?

The **Zones** are the diagnostic: Where specifically is clarity or confidence lacking? Which FIRES element needs attention?

Zones tell you *where* to focus. Predictability tells you *how ready* you are to move forward.

## The Relational Insight

All practices become more powerful when they involve others.

**Research foundation** (Eskreis-Winkler, Fishbach, Duckworth):
- Giving advice is MORE motivating than receiving it
- Middle schoolers who gave advice studied 38% more than those receiving advice
- 75% found giving advice more motivating across domains
- Only 33% predicted this â€” people systematically underestimate the power of giving

**Why it works:**
- Being asked implies you possess the ability
- Prompts memory search for past successes (surfaces proof)
- Makes you feel powerful and competent
- Receiving advice can feel stigmatizing

**The gift is in the asking.**

This is why the tools work in pairs. When someone asks you "how did you do that?" â€” they're not just being polite. They're helping you surface proof you forgot you had. And in doing so, they learn something transferable.

**Questions build integrity in both directions.**

---

# PART 3: THE TOOL SYSTEM
*Update when tools or methodology change*

---

## Tools as Training

The tools are not just assessment instruments. They are practice environments.

The act of answering forces articulation. The AI feedback reveals where communication breaks down. Repeated use trains the skill â€” not just measures the state.

**Why clarity is an integrity issue:**

If you can't articulate your priorities clearly, your team doesn't know what you actually think â€” no matter how honest you feel. If you can't describe your proof, others can't learn from you or trust your judgment. If you can't communicate what you predict, no one can move with you.

The tools surface this gap. They show you: "Here's what you said. Here's how clear it was. Here's where the drift is."

**What the AI measures:**

| Signal | What It Looks Like |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Clarity** | Specific, simple, single-focus. Low hedging. Concrete language. |
| **Confidence** | Evidence provided. Process described. Specifics, not assertions. |
| **Alignment** | Stated priorities match described actions. Claims supported by proof. |

Improving clarity isn't about being a better speaker. It's about closing the integrity gap between what you mean and what others receive.

**The Predictability Score** isn't a grade. It's feedback on how ready you are to communicate when it counts.

## System Overview

Finding Good is a three-tool integrity system. Each tool maps to one of the three practices, has a distinct cadence, and trains a specific capacity.

| Tool | Cadence | Practice | Trains | Promise |
|------|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Priority Builder** | Daily | Prioritize | Clarity | Name what matters â€” and share it |
| **Prove Tool** | Weekly/Episodic | Prove | Confidence | Own the actions that created your outcomes |
| **Predict Tool** | Periodic / Entry | Predict | Predictability | See where you're going â€” together |

**The Flow:**
```
Predict (sets focus) â†’ Priority Builder (daily clarity practice) â†’ Prove (weekly evidence synthesis)
               â†‘______________________________________________________|
                             (Inform next Predict cycle)
```

**Entry Point:** Predict Tool first. It creates the baseline â€” Predictability Score, zone placement per FIRES element, areas needing clarity or confidence. This is where users learn FIRES explicitly.

**Daily Practice:** Priority Builder. Surfaces what matters today, creates shareable clarity, trains articulation. FIRES extracted by AI, not user-selected.

**Weekly Synthesis:** Prove Tool. Collects evidence, tests "how did you do that?" questioning, builds proof you can repeat. FIRES extracted by AI.

---

## Tool 1: Predict Tool

**Old name:** Alignment Builder / FIRES Snapshot  
**Cadence:** Monthly / Quarterly / Entry Point  
**Time:** ~10-15 minutes  
**Practice:** Predict  
**Promise:** See how ready you are to move forward â€” and where the gaps are

### The Insight

Prediction isn't fortune-telling. It's clarity plus confidence.

When you know what matters (priorities) and you know how you've done hard things before (proof), you can see where you're going. The Predict Tool measures whether you have both â€” and shows you where the gaps are.

**The intervention is the instrument.** The act of answering changes your relationship to your goal in real time.

### Core Mechanic

1. **Define the goal/challenge:** What are you trying to accomplish? What matters most right now?
2. **Answer FIRES questions:** Explicit FIRES-framed questions (this is where users learn the framework)
3. **AI Assessment:** Measures clarity, confidence, and alignment from responses
4. **Receive Predictability Score + Zone Map:** Overall readiness plus per-element diagnostic

### What the AI Measures

| FIRES Element | Clarity Check | Confidence Check |
|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| Feelings | Can they name the signal simply? | Evidence of when it showed up? |
| Ethics | Can they state what matters without a tangled list? | Times they acted on it? |
| Influence | Can they name what they control specifically? | Where they've exercised it? |
| Resilience | Can they describe how they handle difficulty? | Times they've done it? |
| Strengths | Can they name what they bring? | Proof with examples? |

### Key Outputs

- **Predictability Score:** Overall clarity + confidence + alignment (0-100)
- **Zone Placement:** Per-FIRES element â€” where is clarity/confidence strong or weak?
- **Gap Indicators:** "Your Ethics clarity is high, but confidence is low â€” you know what matters but can't point to when you've acted on it"
- **Focus Areas:** What to work on in daily/weekly practice

### Team Version Modes

- **Joint:** Team completes together about shared goal (shared priorities, shared proof)
- **Individual â†’ Compare:** Each completes about shared goal, then overlay (reveals alignment gaps)
- **Cross-Prediction:** I complete YOUR map, you complete mine (tests mutual understanding)

**Team Predictability reveals:**
- Low alignment + high individual confidence = dangerous (everyone sure about different things)
- High alignment + low clarity = stuck (agree we don't know)
- High alignment + high clarity/confidence = predictable (can execute)

---

## Tool 2: Priority Builder

**Old name:** Impact Amplifier  
**Cadence:** Daily  
**Time:** ~2-5 minutes  
**Practice:** Prioritize  
**Promise:** Name what matters â€” and share it

### The Insight

Priority isn't what you say is important. It's what you ask about. What you share at the end of the day. What you make easy to capture.

The Priority Builder makes this visible â€” to yourself and to others.

When you articulate what mattered today and share it, you:
- Clarify what you actually prioritize (not what you think you should)
- Create shareable clarity others can act on
- Train the skill of clear articulation

When you name someone else's impact on you, they:
- Receive witnessed priority (you noticed, which means it mattered)
- Learn what you value (without you having to lecture them)
- Are invited into the practice themselves

### Core Mechanic

**Priority Builder â€” Self:**
1. "What level of impact did you have on what matters most today?" (1-3: Light / Balanced / Deeper)
2. "What were you doing that mattered?" (specific activity)
3. Questions scaled to level: What went well? What was your part? What was the impact?
4. AI extracts FIRES signals from natural language
5. AI measures clarity + confidence
6. Receive shareable "Priority Line"

**Priority Builder â€” Other:**
1. Name the person
2. Answer: What did they do? What did it show? How did it affect you?
3. Consistent questions (no difficulty selection)
4. Receive Impact Card to share with them
5. They're invited to reflect on their own priorities

### The Training Effect

The AI feedback shows:
- "Your response was vague â€” what specifically happened?"
- "You named the outcome but not what you did to create it"
- "This is clear and specific â€” ready to share"

Over time, users get sharper. The daily practice trains articulation that transfers to real conversations.

---

## Tool 3: Prove Tool

**Old name:** Finding Good Validation  
**Cadence:** Weekly or when success/challenge happens  
**Time:** ~10 minutes  
**Practice:** Prove  
**Promise:** Own the actions that created your outcomes

### The Insight

Proof is not feeling like you did a good job. Proof is owning the actions that created the outcome.

If you can't articulate how you got there, you can't repeat it. If you can't repeat it, you don't own it â€” you got lucky.

The Prove Tool forces process articulation and builds evidence you can draw on when facing new challenges.

### Core Mechanic

**Self mode:**
1. What's the goal/challenge/thing that mattered?
2. Choose difficulty level (1-3)
3. Questions: How did it happen? What was meaningful? How did it feel? Biggest influence? Where have you done something like this before?
4. Close: What do you think you can do now?
5. AI extracts FIRES signals
6. AI measures clarity + confidence

**Send to Others mode:**
- "I saw you do X â€” tell me how"
- Consistent questions (no difficulty selection)
- Surfaces their proof, you learn something transferable

**Request mode:**
- "How did you see me doing X?"
- Ask someone else to reflect on YOUR proof
- Builds external evidence, strengthens relationship

### AI Assessment

- **Confidence Score:** Did you articulate process with evidence, or just outcomes?
- **Transferability Check:** Can what you described be repeated? Taught to others?
- **Prediction Accuracy:** Compare last week's "future" to this week's "past" â€” are you getting better at predicting?

### The Training Effect

- "You described what happened but not how â€” what specifically did you do?"
- "Strong process description. This is repeatable."
- "Last week you predicted X. You reported Y. What accounts for the gap?"

Over time, users build a library of proof. When facing new challenges, the tool can surface: "You've handled similar situations before. Here's what you did."

## The Coaching Methodology: PRIORITIZE â†’ PROVE â†’ PREDICT

The 12-week Narrative Integrity coaching engagement follows three phases:

| Phase | Weeks | Focus | What's Getting Clearer |
|-------|-------|-------|------------------------|
| **PRIORITIZE** | 1-4 | Name what actually matters | The real goal/challenge, what they care about vs. what they think they should, what they're willing to ask about |
| **PROVE** | 5-8 | Own the actions that created outcomes | What actually works, how they've done hard things before, evidence they're not accessing |
| **PREDICT** | 9-12 | Align so they can see what's coming | How to hold clarity and confidence under pressure, ability to articulate to others, how to build shared prediction |

### The Coaching Philosophy

**The coaching IS the curriculum.**

You're not teaching curiosity in a specific week â€” you're being curious the whole time. The skill transfer happens through:
1. **Experiencing it** â€” you do it to them
2. **Naming it** â€” debrief what happened
3. **Practicing it** â€” they do it with others (and in the tools)
4. **Proving it** â€” Priority Builder and Prove Tool capture the evidence

**The tools as training:**
Coaching sessions surface insights. Tools train articulation between sessions. The clearer they get in the tools, the clearer they get in real conversations.

### More/Less Markers

Captured in Session 1 (PRIORITIZE phase) and updated throughout. These become "what matters most" anchors.

- What do you want MORE of as a result of this work? (3-5 items)
- What do you want LESS of? (3-5 items)
- Rate each: Where are you now (1-10)? Where do you want to be?

**Key Insight:** Every "more of" has a corresponding "less of." The check-in explores this exchange.

**Integration:** More/Less markers feed into Predict Tool as the "what matters most" anchor.

## Speaking & Workshop Delivery Model

Speaking engagements are the primary conversion engine. The workshop structure walks participants through PRIORITIZE â†’ PROVE â†’ PREDICT in a single session, creating three practice moments with the same partner.

### Workshop Flow

**1. PRIORITIZE â€” Priority Builder (Partner Exchange)**
- Pair with someone who has positively impacted you
- Complete Priority Builder about your partner
- Exchange and discuss
- Demonstrates: naming what matters, the gift is in the asking, questions reveal priority

**2. PROVE â€” "How did you do that?" (Partner Questioning)**
- Stay with same partner
- Person A shares recent success
- Person B asks "how did you do that?" + follow-ups to surface process
- Switch roles
- Demonstrates: proof is evidence not feeling, questions build integrity both directions

**3. PREDICT â€” Partner Prediction (Challenge Application)**
- Same partner â€” they now know your priorities and have heard your proof
- Apply to a real challenge: What do you need to prioritize? What proof do you have?
- Partner helps surface gaps and connections
- Demonstrates: prediction is clarity + confidence, built relationally not individually

### Why Same Partner Throughout

By PREDICT, your partner has received your priorities and heard your proof. They can actually help you see what you can't see alone. This is the payoff â€” live demonstration of what shared priority and shared proof creates.

### Follow-Up

- Link + code to complete Predict Tool
- Tool completion creates natural appointment-setting opportunity
- Provides data visible before conversation
- Proof of concept for enterprise buyers

### The Teaching Arc

The workshop demonstrates:
1. **What we were designed to do** â€” campfire questions, sharing, building clarity together
2. **What we've forgotten** â€” the questions that build integrity
3. **How the tools systematize it** â€” PRIORITIZE â†’ PROVE â†’ PREDICT as repeatable daily/weekly practice

## Cross-Tool Data Flow

All tools share a single Supabase project. Email (`client_email`) is the universal identifier.

### Dashboard Focus

**Front and center:** What matters to this person (goals/challenges they've named)

**Metrics:**
- Priority check-ins (frequency + clarity trend)

## Proof Tool - What's Live

**Deployed:** January 7, 2026  
**URL:** proof.findinggood.com  
**Built with:** Claude Code (React + TypeScript + Vite + Supabase)

### Three Modes

| Mode | Description | Flow |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Self Mode** | Reflect on YOUR success | Goal → Intensity → Questions → AI Analysis → Results |
| **Request Mode** | Ask someone for perspective on YOUR success | Create request → Share link → Recipient responds → View in history |
| **Send to Others** | Help someone ELSE surface THEIR proof | Notice their success → Share link → They reflect → Celebration (no grades) |

### Features

- **AI Scoring** with detailed rubrics:
  - **Confidence** (1-5): "Do you own the HOW?"
  - **Clarity** (1-5): "Can you articulate it simply?"
  - **Ownership** (1-5): "Do you claim your actions?"
  
- **FIRES Extraction**: AI detects Feelings, Influence, Resilience, Ethics, Strengths from responses

- **Proof Line**: AI-generated shareable one-sentence summary

- **Pattern Recognition**: whatWorked, whyItWorked, howToRepeat

- **Weekly Pulse Check**: Rotating 2-question check-in

- **Predictions**: Predict → Review accuracy cycle

### Tech Stack

- Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- Backend: Supabase (same project as other tools)
- AI: Claude API via Supabase Edge Functions
- Deployment: Vercel
- Repository: findinggood1/finding-good-prove-tool

### Remaining Polish Items

- [ ] Results page reordering (scores, FIRES, insight, proof line, pattern)
- [ ] Explainer popups for scores and FIRES elements
- [ ] Email notifications via Supabase Edge Functions
- [ ] PDF export of proof library
- [ ] Coach Dashboard integration

# APPENDIX: POSITIONING REFERENCE

## Core Positioning

**The through-line:**

> "Most leaders unknowingly lose trust â€” not because of what they're doing, but because of the questions they aren't asking."

**The false choice:**
- One side says relationships don't matter â€” just execute
- The other side says we need to be like family
- Both fail for the same reason: the actual dependency is integrity

**The design anchor:**

This isn't new. You're built for this. You just stopped doing it.

---

## Positioning Angles

**For exhausted leaders:**
> "Tired of having the same conversations and hoping this time it sticks? It's not a communication problem. It's not a motivation problem. You've stopped asking the questions humans are designed to ask â€” the ones that build real clarity, real proof, and real prediction. Finding Good brings them back."

**For trust/delegation problems:**
> "You can't trust your team to deliver without constant oversight. But trust isn't built by hoping or bonding. It's built by shared clarity on what matters, proven reliability in how you work, and the ability to predict what each other will do. That's integrity. And you're designed to build it together."

**For strategy execution failures:**
> "You agreed on the strategy. Everyone nodded. Then nothing happened. Agreement isn't alignment. Alignment is when you can predict what each other will do â€” because you share clarity on priorities and proof of how you work. Finding Good builds that. Not through team-building or more meetings. Through three questions you forgot to ask."

**For keynote/inspiration:**
> "For millions of years, the challenges we faced together built the trust we needed. The questions we asked around the fire created clarity no memo ever could. We've forgotten those questions. Finding Good brings them back. Not because you're broken. Because you're designed for something you stopped doing."

---

## The Anchor Line

> "Finding Good helps people build integrity â€” the ability to trust each other based on shared clarity and proven reliability â€” through three practices: Prioritize, Prove, Predict."

---

## Differentiated Positioning

> "Unlike team-building that doesn't transfer to work, or strategy sessions that never get executed â€” Finding Good builds the operational integrity that makes both possible."

> "If you can't communicate clearly enough for others to act on it, you don't have integrity with them. You have good intentions with poor delivery."

---

## Key Language

| Use | Avoid |
|-----|-------|
| Narrative Integrity | Transformation |
| Clarity / Confidence | Soft skills |
| Proof / Evidence | Feedback |
| Prioritize, Prove, Predict | Name, Validate, Align (old framework) |
| Integrity (functional reliability) | Trust (vague) |
| Questions reveal priority | Setting priorities |
| Emergence (bringing out what's there) | Becoming something different |
| Tools as training | Assessment |
| Unknowingly lose trust | Bad leader / poor communication |
| Good intentions, poor delivery | Dishonest / not trying |
