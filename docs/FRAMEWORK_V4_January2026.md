# Finding Good Framework V4

**Date:** January 24, 2026  
**Purpose:** Capture refined framework from coaching-focused iteration

---

## The Core Insight

**Permission before Priority.**

Before someone can meaningfully prioritize, they need to give themselves *permission* to name what actually matters—not what they think *should* matter.

---

## The Complete Stack

```
PERMISSION (What matters most)
    ↓
Defines ONE anchor action + up to 3 activities
    ↓
PREDICT (Goals/challenges tied to what matters)
    ↓
Multiple goals under one "what matters most"
    ↓
DAILY CHECK-IN (Did you do your most important things?)
    ↓
30 seconds: tap to confirm activities
    ↓
PRIORITY (What went well?)
    ↓
Capture how activities showed up today—they look different daily
    ↓
PROOF (Evidence it's working)
    ↓
Document how you show up when you succeed
    ↓
CAMPFIRE (Share + see others)
    ↓
Social reinforcement, requests, visibility
    ↓
Back to PREDICT (update confidence, refine goals)
```

---

## The Structure (Using Brian's Example)

```
ONE "What Matters Most": Lead a purposeful life
           ↓
ONE Anchor Action: Connection
           ↓
Multiple Goals under that prediction:
├── Health
├── Sustainable business  
└── Community
           ↓
Activities (all expressions of "connection"):
├── Connect with self (workout, mental health)
├── Integrity in business (calls, creation)
└── Reaching out to others
```

**Key Insight:** The anchor action isn't a specific task—it's the *theme* that runs through everything. "Connection" shows up differently in each goal area, but it's the same muscle.

## Tool Purposes (Refined)

| Tool | Purpose | Cadence | Output |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| **Permission** | Define anchor action + activities | Once, refined over time | Populates Campfire check-in |
| **Predict** | Define what matters most + goals | Entry point | Creates the container |
| **Daily Check-in** | Track activity completion | Daily (30 sec) | Yes/No data + prompts |
| **Priority** | Capture what went well | 2x/week (self-guided) or daily (coaching) | Refinement data |
| **Proof** | Document evidence | 2x/month (self-guided) or weekly (coaching) | Confidence data |
| **Campfire** | Share + see others | Ongoing | Social reinforcement |

---

## The Daily Loop

1. **Text/notification arrives:** "Did you do your most important things today?"
2. **They tap to respond** → routes to Campfire
3. **Campfire shows:** "3 people shared priorities. Do yours to see theirs."
4. **They engage** → creates content for others' loops tomorrow
5. **Ping others:** "Did you do your most important things?"

---

## The Learning Loop

Every Priority logged teaches: "This is what connection looked like today."
Every Proof logged teaches: "This is how I show up when I succeed."

That data is valuable for:
- **Self:** Patterns emerge about how you naturally show up
- **Dyad partners:** "When Brian is at his best, he does X"
- **Coach:** Where clarity/confidence is building or lagging

---

## Connection Makes Everything Meaningful

When someone sends an impact or proof, they're not saying "you did a nice thing."  
They're saying "you touched the thing that matters most to me."

That's a fundamentally different message. It tells the receiver: *you are important*.

When someone shares in Campfire, they're not sharing random positives.  
They're sharing evidence of what matters most.

---

## Discovery + Strategy Simultaneously

The tools are not linear. They form a living system:

```
Connection (Campfire, dyad, coaching)
    ↓
Higher self-awareness
    ↓
Clearer "what matters most"
    ↓
Better anchor action / activities
    ↓
More meaningful sharing
    ↓
Deeper connection
    ↓
(repeat, refining each time)
```

Every tool is both **discovery** and **strategy**:
- Logging a priority = strategic action + discovering what actually matters
- Sending a proof = strategic reinforcement + discovering your impact
- Sharing in Campfire = strategic visibility + discovering through others' responses

---

## Campfire as Home Base

The "unified login + landing page" becomes less critical if **Campfire IS the landing page** and the daily text/notification is the primary entry point.

The other tools (Priority, Proof, Predict) become **actions you take from Campfire**, not separate destinations.

---

## User Types + Cadences

| User Type | Daily Check-in | Priority | Proof |
|-----------|----------------|----------|-------|
| Self-guided | Yes | 2x/week | 2x/month |
| Active coaching | Yes | Daily | Weekly |

Active coaching clients have more to work off with each other in their dyad sessions.

---

## What the Coach Needs to See

**Front and center:** What matters to this person (the anchor action + goals)

**Metrics:**
- Daily check-in completion (streaks, consistency)
- Priority capture frequency + clarity trend
- Proof pieces collected + confidence trend
- FIRES signals extracted over time

**The question:** Where is clarity/confidence building or lagging across what matters to the client?

---

## What Paying Clients Get (vs. Free)

- AI chat function (from v1)
- More customized choices
- Coach visibility into their data
- Dyad partner connections
- Notification system for assignments

---

## The Thesis in Product Form

**Brian's core belief:** Everything a person needs is already within them—it just needs drawn out.

**How this shows up:**
- The "what matters most" was always there
- The anchor action was always available
- The activities were already happening (or could be)
- The people contributing were always around
- **The tool makes it visible and nameable**

## Connection to Revenue

This framework serves coaching clients directly, which:
1. Makes current $6-8k/month clients more successful
2. Creates proof for enterprise conversations
3. Demonstrates the model that can be white-labeled
4. Provides workshop content that converts to coaching
